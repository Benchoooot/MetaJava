This JavaScript code defines an array of NFT objects, each representing a non-fungible token with properties such as name, size, properties, color, and brand.

The `mintNFT` function takes an NFT object as an argument, adds it to the `NFTs` array, and returns the newly minted NFT.

The `listNFTs` function iterates through the `NFTs` array and logs each NFT object to the console.

The `getTotalSupply` function logs the total number of NFTs in the `NFTs` array to the console.

The code then calls the `mintNFT` function twice to create two new NFTs, and then calls the `listNFTs` and `getTotalSupply` functions to display the newly minted NFTs and the total supply of NFTs.
